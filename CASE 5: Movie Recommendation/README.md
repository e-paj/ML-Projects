**Date**: Nov. 04 - 09

📝
**Workflow**:
- data collection (i.e. genres. description, director, etc.)
- Data pre-processing
- Feature extraction (covert textual to numerical values)
- user input
- cosine similarity algorithm (calculate the similarity given by the user to the other movies in the dataset)
- list of movies (what to suggest to user)

🔢
**Dataset**: [Movies Data](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%205:%20Movie%20Recommendation/DATA)
