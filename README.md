# 🎇 Machine Learning Projects 🎇

The aim of this is to showcase Machine Learning Projects that I did!!

### Legend:
- ✔ = project is finished
- ❌ = project is being planned, yet to start.
- ↔ = project is in motion, not finished

## Case Studies:
1. Customer Segmentation
2. Detecting Parkinsons Disease
3. Medical Insurance Cost
4. Neural Networks 

## Description:
Following are the projects/case studies I have done in the Machine Learning Field and its descriptions. Projects are grouped by learning styles:

### Supervised Learning
| **Name** | **Description** |
| :------: | :-------------: |
| [Detecting Parkinson's Disease](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%202:%20Detecting%20Parkinsons%20Disease) | SVM implementation to predict if a patient is disease positive or not |
| [Medical Insurance Cost](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%203:%20Medical%20Insurance%20Cost)| Implement a Linear Regression model to predict the cost of insurance depending on several factors.  |

### Unsupervised Learning
| **Name** | **Description** |
| :------: | :-------------: |
| [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%201:%20Customer%20Segmentation%20Project) | Implementation of k-Means Clustering to classify customers based on the income and spending score |
