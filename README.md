# üéá Machine Learning Projects üéá

The aim of this is to showcase Machine Learning Projects that I did in Python!!

**Legend**:
- ‚úî = project is finished
- ‚ùå = project is being planned, yet to start.
- ‚Üî = project is in motion, not finished

## Case Studies:
1. Customer Segmentation ‚úî
2. Detecting Parkinsons Disease ‚úî
3. Medical Insurance Cost ‚úî
4. Mushroom Classification ‚úî
5. Movie Recommendation ‚úî
6. Webscraping Wikipedia for group discrographies ‚Üî
7. Breast Cancer Detection ‚úî
8. Chatbots ‚Üî
9. Stock Prices ‚ùå
10. Mental Health in Tech ‚úî
11. Song Prediction ‚ùå


## Description:
Following are the projects/case studies I have done in the Machine Learning Field and its descriptions. Projects are grouped by learning styles:

### Supervised Learning
| **Name** | **Description** |
| :------: | :-------------: |
| [Detecting Parkinson's Disease](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%202:%20Detecting%20Parkinsons%20Disease) | SVM implementation to predict if a patient is disease positive or not |
| [Medical Insurance Cost](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%203:%20Medical%20Insurance%20Cost)| Implement a Linear Regression model to predict the cost of insurance depending on several factors.  |
| [Mushroom Classification](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%204:%20Mushrooms) | Decision Trees implementation to predict if a mushroom is edible or poisonous |
| [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects-in-Python/tree/main/CASE%207:%20Breast%20Cancer) | Implement Logistic Regression model to accurately predict if breast cancer is benign or not |

### Unsupervised Learning
| **Name** | **Description** |
| :------: | :-------------: |
| [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%201:%20Customer%20Segmentation%20Project) | Implementation of k-Means Clustering to classify customers based on the income and spending score |

### Neither
| **Name** | **Description** |
| :------: | :-------------: |
| [Movie Recommendation](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%205:%20Movie%20Recommendation) | Build a recommendation system based on content and popularity by calculating Cosine Similarity. |
| [Webscraping](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects-in-Python/tree/main/CASE%206:%20Web%20Scraping) | Code to webscrape a Wikipedia page (specifically for a discography page) |
| [Mental Health in Tech](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects-in-Python/tree/main/CASE%2010:%20Mental%20Health) | Visualization that shows any patterns in the mental health of people working in tech. |
