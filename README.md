# ðŸŽ‡ Machine Learning Projects ðŸŽ‡

The aim of this is to showcase Machine Learning Projects that I did!!

## Case Studies:
1. Customer Segmentation: using k-Means Clustering
2. Detecting Parkinsons Disease: using Support Vector Machine model
3. Medical Insurance Cost: using Linear Regression

## Description:
Following are the projects/case studies I have done in the Machine Learning Field and its descriptions:

| **Name** | **Description** |
| :------: | :-------------: |
| [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%201:%20Customer%20Segmentation%20Project) | Implementation of k-Means Clustering to classify customers based on the income and spending score |
| [Detecting Parkinson's Disease](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%202:%20Detecting%20Parkinsons%20Disease) | SVM implementation to predict if a patient is disease positive or not |
| [Medical Insurance Cost](https://github.com/e-paj/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/CASE%203:%20Medical%20Insurance%20Cost)|  |
