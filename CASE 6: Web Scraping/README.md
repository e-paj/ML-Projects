# ðŸ–¥ Web Scraping ðŸ–¥

ðŸ’¡**Objective**: This is a web scraping code using Python to be utilized in Wikipedia. It can be used in the future if you want to compare group growth based on chart ratings of an album; or to compare the discrography of each group to see how they differ music wise.

- Some ideas to anlalyze using these web scraping code:
  - What are the music genre that is most prevelant in each group? Are there groups that share the same genre? If so, which group is faring better on the charts? 
  - What music genre do each group see the most rise on charts? Forecast what would happen (chart-wise) if they maintain the genre?
